Implement a Sudoku Solver
# 🧩 Sudoku Solver

## 📌 Task-04 | Prodigy Infotech

This project is part of **Task-04** completed during my internship at **Prodigy Infotech**.  
The goal of this task is to implement a **Sudoku Solver** that automatically solves a given Sudoku puzzle using an efficient algorithm.

---

## 📝 Description

The Sudoku Solver program takes an incomplete **9×9 Sudoku grid** as input and fills in the missing numbers while following standard Sudoku rules.  
The solution is achieved using the **backtracking algorithm**, which explores possible number placements and finds the correct arrangement for the puzzle.

Once solved, the program displays the **completed Sudoku grid**.

## ⚙️ Features

- Solves standard 9×9 Sudoku puzzles
- Uses backtracking algorithm
- Validates Sudoku rules (row, column, and 3×3 sub-grid)
- Displays solved Sudoku grid
- Efficient and beginner-friendly implementation

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

**Backtracking Algorithm**
- Finds empty cells in the grid
- Tries numbers from 1 to 9
- Checks if the number is valid
- Recursively continues until the puzzle is solved
- Backtracks if a conflict occurs
